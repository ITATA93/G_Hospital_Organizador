### TASK-2026-0003: Classify and archive unused Claude skills ✅
- **From**: AG_Plantilla
- **Priority**: P2-Medium
- **Status**: DONE (2026-02-18)
- **Created**: 2026-02-18
- **Description**: Classified 28 Claude skills by domain relevance. Archived 18 NO_APLICA skills (11 official, 7 community) to `_archived/` subdirectories. Kept 4 RELEVANT (doc-coauthoring, docx, pdf, xlsx) and 6 GENERIC (skill-creator, obra-superpowers x3, skill-seekers-tool, trailofbits-security).

### [P2] EVALUATE AGENTS AND SKILLS ✅
- Status: DONE (2026-02-18)
- Source: AG_Plantilla (ecosystem consolidation 2026-02-18)
- **Agents (7/7 relevant)**: code-analyst, doc-writer, code-reviewer, test-writer, db-analyst, deployer, researcher — all applicable to SAIA's Python codebase, documentation, security-sensitive file ops, tests, DB metadata, deployment automation, and compliance research
- **Claude skills**: No actual skills found (only reference files in .claude/skills/) — nothing to archive
- **Gemini skills**: No executable skills found (only reference docs in .gemini/skills/) — nothing to archive
- **Antigravity skill**: `document-processor` (.agent/skills/document_processing/) — relevant, kept
- **Workflows**: `autonomous_maintenance.md` — still valid, references existing scripts in scripts/
- Result: No changes needed. All agents are relevant. No skills to archive.
